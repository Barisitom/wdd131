            <img id="img1" src="images/barpic.jpeg" alt="Barisitom pic">
            <p>I am Barisitom Akpee, a proud Nigerian from the heart of Africa, 
                dedicated to serving in the healthcare sector. At Diadem Consult, 
                a respected health facility, I bring my expertise to bear, shining 
                with a strong commitment to service. Being the second of three boys, 
                I carry the values of unity and responsibility instilled in me by
                 my Nigerian upbringing. My journey reflects resilience and purpose,
                  woven into the vibrant tapestry of African culture.</p>

                and Anambra states to the north, AkwaIbom State to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean 
                to the south. The capital of Rivers State is Port Harcourt, which is also the
                 largest city in the state and a major economic hub.
