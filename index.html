            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Barisitom Akpee, a proud Nigerian from the heart of Africa, 
                dedicated to serving in the healthcare sector. At Diadem Consult, 
                a respected health facility, I bring my expertise to bear, shining 
                with a strong commitment to service. Being the second of three boys, 
                I carry the values of unity and responsibility instilled in me by
                 my Nigerian upbringing. My journey reflects resilience and purpose,
                  woven into the vibrant tapestry of African culture.</p>
